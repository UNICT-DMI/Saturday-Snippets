# K8s Hands On
## Abstract 

> "Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications." [Source](https://kubernetes.io/) 

In the last years two technologies: containers and clouds  , have been widely and fastly adopted,
containers allow "empowered app development and sharing", cloud computing introduced scalable and cost effective resources to run computer programs.

The combination of these technologies find its best match in Kubernetes, the on-the-edge de facto standard technology that make containers be able to run and interact in a secure, scalable and reliable enviroment.

In this seminar, we will try k8s using a local test enviroment introducing the basic components and api and creating an "hello world" application, and give a look to real case applications.

The only requirement is a computer, some ram and cpu and spirit of fun!
